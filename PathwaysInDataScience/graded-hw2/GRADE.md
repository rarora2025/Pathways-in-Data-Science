# Instructor comments

-1: Incorrect calculation of MSE in (a); you need to divide the sum of the residuals calculated by np.polyfit by len(Y) for full credit

-0.5: Inaccurate plot in (c) due to incorrect calculation of MSE

-1: Incorrect application of best_poly in (d); you should use it on train_X and train_Y to generate the polynomials, then test it on large_X to find mean squared error for test_Y

-0.3: Inaccurate analysis due to incorrect application of best_poly in (d)

-0.2: No axis labels for the plot in (d)

+1.5: Corrections

Good work!
